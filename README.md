# MATH4230-cuhk
The file is designed to help the lecture of Optimzation Theory - MATH4230 from CUHK

Most of the content is inspired from G. Lan, First-order and Stochastic Optimization Methods for Machine Learning, Spriner 2020.
D. Michael Patriksson, An Introduction to Continuous Optimization: Foundations and Fundamental Algorithms, Third Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics), 2020

What I did is add more numercial examples and graphics for better understanding.
